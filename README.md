# COVID Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 death records and vaccination data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic and the effectiveness of vaccination efforts. The analysis focuses on examining patterns, trends within the COVID-19 data and comparing them with vaccination data to understand the relationship between vaccinations and COVID-19 outcomes.

## Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Death Records**: The COVID-19 death records dataset provides information about the total number of cases, deaths, and other relevant metrics for different locations and time periods. The data is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- **COVID-19 Vaccination Data**: The COVID-19 vaccination dataset contains information about the total population, total tests conducted, number of people vaccinated, and other vaccination-related metrics for various locations.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates across different continents, countries, and regions.
- Identify correlations between COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates to assess the impact of vaccination on reducing COVID-19 transmission and mortality.
- Explore temporal trends and patterns in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates over time to understand the progression of the pandemic and the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns.
- Conduct comparative analyses between regions or countries with different vaccination strategies or levels of vaccination coverage to evaluate the effectiveness of different vaccination approaches.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server is used to store and manage the COVID-19 death records and vaccination data.
- **SQL**: Structured Query Language (SQL) is utilized for data manipulation, querying, and analysis.
- **GitHub**: GitHub is used for version control and collaboration, allowing for the sharing and documentation of code and analysis findings.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or explore the data further:
1. Access the COVID-19 death records and vaccination datasets.
2. Import the datasets into a SQL database management system (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server).
3. Run SQL queries to analyze the data, extract insights, and generate visualizations.
4. Optionally, use Python for additional data preprocessing, analysis, or visualization tasks.
